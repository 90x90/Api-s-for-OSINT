## How to learn how to work with REST API?
If you don't know how to work with the REST API, I recommend you check out the Netlas API guide I wrote for Netlas.io.

Netlas Cookbook(https://github.com/netlas-io/netlas-cookbook)

There it is very brief and accessible to write how to automate requests in different programming languages (focus on Python and Bash) and process the resulting JSON data.
